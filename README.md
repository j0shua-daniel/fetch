# NO LONGER MAINTAINED! I no longer support linux and what the linux foundation does and I will NOT make any script/software to improve experience on linux. [More info](https://gist.github.com/j0shua-daniel/65abe881f363a007a2f4efcb08cc5a4a).

# Fetch
A blazing fast bash fetch!

## Speed

On slower computers it is faster than fastfetch.

But on faster computers [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) wins.

It is about 2x faster than [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)

## Install:
No support for BSD & MacOS **yet**!

Make sure `lscpu` is installed.

```
sudo curl -o /usr/bin/fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j0shua-daniel/fetch/refs/heads/main/fetch
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/fetch
```
