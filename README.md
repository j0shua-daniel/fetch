## Speed

On slower computers it is faster than fastfetch.

But on faster computers [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) wins.

It is about 2x faster than [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)

Make sure `lscpu` is installed.

```
sudo curl -o /usr/bin/fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j0shua-daniel/fetch/refs/heads/main/fetch
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/fetch
```
