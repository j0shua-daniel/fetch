## Speed

On slower computers it is faster than fastfetch.

But on faster computers fastfetch wins.

## Install:
No support for BSD & MacOS **yet**!

Make sure `lscpu` is installed.

```
sudo curl -o /usr/bin/fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j0shua-daniel/fetch/refs/heads/main/fetch
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/fetch
```
